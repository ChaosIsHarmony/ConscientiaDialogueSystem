But a kindred trait does it find in that here, too, all light is natural light seeping in through an opening at its zenith.\n\n\t\tShe begins her climb. Step summing upon step, an apparently unending ascension skywards up the shaft of a large square tower tries Eidos' patience, stretching it to a hair's breadth. That she makes her way up is clear; that there is any reward in this climb remains a mystery.\n\n\t\tBut as she presses on, the passage seems to get ever warmer, and in time, she reaches the top - evidenced by the now-visible portal inviting her to exit the indifferent infinity of stairs.",

Glistening, blue liquid slowly leaks from its wounds, serving as a natural highlight of the sentry's figure.\n\n\t\tIn an alcove, nearly consumed in shadows, a Glyph etched upon a floating platform appears to call to her, offering an escape.",
