However, she actually killed it as the result of a cult meeting. However, you run the risk of getting dragged into the cult if you follow her delusions. There are two ways this could turn out. If you choose to stay around in the forest, you can discover the place in the forest where they conduct their rituals. However, there is nothing there, except a standing stone. There are no bones or fire or the trappings of ritual that she witnessed. This will cause Thetian to become part of the cult's dream. On the other hand, you can take her back to Valonheim. She will insist on going to see Vitriox.\n\t\t\n\t\tI found a woman in ragged clothes.
